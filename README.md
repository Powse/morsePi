# morsePi
A simple program that sends Morse code signals(generated from user input) to a chosen RaspberryPi GPIO.  
I apologize if the coding is horrible, it was my first rPi GPIO and Python encounter. Data was taken from the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) :)

Developed with Python 3.4 and the RPi.GPIO Python module.  
Tested and built on ArchLinux ARM (ARMv6).
